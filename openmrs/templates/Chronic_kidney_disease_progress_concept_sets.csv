(sudden anasarca, little/no urine, rapidly changing Cr over few days)<br>
- Stage G4/G5 → consider referral to tertiary center<br>

MEDICATIONS – ACE-i is renal protective!<br>
- ACEi FIRST LINE– enalapril 5mg po daily for stage G2 and worse<br>
- Fluid overload: lasix first line, start 20mg po bid after confirming there is no hypokalemia (low K)<br>

CONSIDER REFERRAL FOR DIALYSIS<br>
